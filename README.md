### List of webpages that work for search engine indexing (in substitute for Google, which doesn't work):

- Bing (URL: "https://www.bing.com/search?pglt=123&q=your+query+here")
- Ecosia (URL: "https://ecosia.org/search?q=your+query+here")
- Yandex (more instructions below)
- Brave (URL: "https://search.brave.com/search?q=your+query+here")

I am sure there is more, but these are the only ones that I know of so far that work with this project.  

#### More info on Bing URL 

**"https://www.bing.com/search?pglt=123&q=your+query+here"**

The '123' in the URL above means any number you choose would work when fetching.

#### How to use Yandex with Parazone 

To use Yandex:
- Fetch the url (https://yandex.com)
- Open the '.html' file using your native browser or Parazone
- Type in your search term and hit enter
- If your browser says 'Site Blocked', 'Access Restricted', etc, copy the link from the search bar and fetch that one as well
- Open the other '.html' file using either your native browser or Parazone
